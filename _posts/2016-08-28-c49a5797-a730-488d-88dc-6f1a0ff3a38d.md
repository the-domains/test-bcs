# You can't dissolve the self into the world of ideas. What you consider to be you is nothing but a conglomeration of ideas and patterns of thought which you have acquired through feedback from your environment. And insomuch as you don't see past that, you remain bound to a sort of lifeless conceptual abstraction which you call your self. Not the real thing... and this abstracted self is very, very small. The true self, however, contains everything. It concretely and categorically IS everything. So there is no problem. There never was one. It's all perfect and complete.
