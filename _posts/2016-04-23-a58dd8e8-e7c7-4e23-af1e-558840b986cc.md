description: 'With the budding of life along the timespan of our universe, there began an age where karmically arranged groupings of matter became functionally united. As simple nervous systems matured, organisms became increasingly self-concerned, none more so than human beings. As such, we have fallen prey to the illusion that our skin creates a wall between us and the world, when truly it is a channel, with what we identify as our selves and the world moving back and forth in constant interchange. Absent this this simple understanding, Self-awareness is by no means a gift, but a grave cost. '
